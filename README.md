# E09a-Scripting
In this exercise we are developing our block game into more of a game. When you play the game now you will see your lives in the top left of the screen and your score in the top right of the screen. Every time the ball hits a block you will notice that your score goes up. Everytime you let the ball off the screen you will see your lives go down. After all three of your lives are gone it will take you to a game over screen. Within the project we changed some script and simply added some new labels for the score and lives, as well as the game over scree.
